Hello world!

I am going to provide a little bit of backround before we continue, I am a recent graduate from Cal State East bay where I got my
M.S in Statsitics. While completing my degree I have conducted some reaserch using this particular data repository, NHANES, and I have 
found that most of the suppourt on the NHANES website is mostly for SAS. While SAS is good, if you are like me then you might want to 
conduct your reaserch using other platforms like R! 

First I would like to say that this project is an attempt to help anybody that would like to conduct reaserch using the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data repository using R. In this project we go from: downloading our data directly from 
the NHANES website using a R package called "RNHANES", to cleaning our data, imputting missing values using a R package called "mi",
proividing some descriptive statistics with graphics, and using logistic regression to try and forecast our results. 



Here is a small introduction into each file that we have in this repository:


File name:"SQL R nhanes 1999-2014 walking imparment"

This file downloads raw data files from 1999-2014 and merges them into a "master" file that is the first start to any reaserch project. 
NHANES breaks down their data into years and within each year they further group certain datasets . This is useful once you 
can navigate the site and once you get a through understading of their data dictorionary. We join our different datasets using basic
SQL commands





Something to note is that you are going to have a fair bit of missing data so you have one of two options: 
you can remove all missing data or you can impute missing values into the dataset.
